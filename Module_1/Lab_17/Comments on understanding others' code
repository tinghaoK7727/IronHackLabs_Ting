Comments on the code:
- Overall this team's code is relatively straightforward and quiet easy to understand.
- However, I have spotted some typos and redundant code elements such as one variable k=0, and an empty list lif6 = []
- I have removed these two redundant codes and added a print(l6) inside the loop so that it will be clearer to see the roll-dice results at every stage.
