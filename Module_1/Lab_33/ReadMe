Steps for Data cleaning:

Step 1:
Check for outliers in each column with Matplot and note them down for later

Step 2:
Depend on the types off outliers, either assign values or delete/drop them to have a consistent dataset

Actions on each column:
Department: redundant information, drop this column from the dataset
BirthYear: 2 NA and one potentially error from input, correct the data
Amount: one outlier (Client 34997 with extreme amount, drop this row)
Profession: fill the NA with info from the same client ID

Step 3:
One last check of the dataset, save to CSV if everything seems ok.
